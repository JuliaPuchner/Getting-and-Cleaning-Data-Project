# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

## Steps to be performed

Create R script called run_analysis.R:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


## How to execute the Script

1. Download the data source and put into a folder on your local computer.
2. Open the script run_analysis.R with R and set the path to the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset'.
3. Execute the script.
4. The output of the script is a file called tiny_data.txt in the directory you set as 'path', which is your working directory.
